# Udacity
This folder includes my projects completed in Data Analyst Nanodegree Udacity. Most of them are python (jupyter notebook). The datasets are from Kaggle.
I will gradually upload the materials to Github in the following months
Expected program completion date: Before December 15th, 2021
Good luck to myself!
